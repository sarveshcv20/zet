Solution created for Part-2

Task 4:
Create a Two tier application infrastructure using Terraform

Created 3 folders --> 
1. Modules
2. network
3. two-tier-arch

I have divided Network & two-tier-arch into two different folders, this gives ease of use. We can also club all as a part of a single folder and use one config

Modules - Stores all the modules, divided all components into modules for re-usability. 

Network - This will intialise the required network infrastructure in aws cloud.
This creates 
VPC 
Security Group's (app and db sg's)
Subnet (Public and Private)
NAT (service)
Note: Output of resources are called and reused in downstream resources eg: vpc id is used by subnets and sg's.


two-tier-arch - This will create two tier arch in aws and use the above created resources
1. app 
2. db

Task 5
Shell script to take third most CPU & Memory consuming process

Note: The question was ambigious, so created two approaches

1 - Provides two outputs - a. 3rd high cpu b. 3rd high memory
2 - Provides single output - sorted with 3rd highest cpu and mem

Task 6
Write a kubernetes (preferably helm) template that deploys nginx with custom configuration and exposes services as NodePort

Create nginx helm chart with service as nodeport and modified with custom configuration index.html 
Created config-map with custom index html and mounted as nginx volume
